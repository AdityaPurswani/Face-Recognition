# Face-Recognition

This is a face recognition project which will take your data while capturing your face when you the user click "c" on there keyboard and forms there own data.
For storing the data a numpy file is created and you can store data of all the faces with there names.

And when you test the model with fresh feed it will recognise if the face details are in the numpy file.
This model is using a KNN(K Nearest Neighbour) Algorithm and can be enhanced by using other algorithms
